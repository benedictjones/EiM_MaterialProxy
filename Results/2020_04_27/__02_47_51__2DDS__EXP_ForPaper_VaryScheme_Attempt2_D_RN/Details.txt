Number of loops = 100 
  > Number of generated circuits = 10 
  > Number of times the generated circuits where tested (num_repetitions) = 10 
Iteratiosn per loop = 40 
Population Size = 20 
mut = 0.800000 
crossp = 0.800000   (Note: perm_crossp_model=none) 
num input nodes = 2 
num configuration nodes = 3 
num output nodes = 2 
num output readings (i.e dimensions) = 1 
Training Data used: 2DDS 
  > Number of classes to optimise for: 2 
  > Data is split for training and verification 
  > Every instance of circuit + repetition is verified (read out in order) 
Using a shuffle gene = 0 
Using input weightings = 1 
  > Input weightings scheme is: random 
  > Input weightings randomly chosen from +/- 1.000000 
Using output weightings = 1 
  > Output weightings scheme is: random 
  > Output weightings randomly chosen from +/- 1.000000 
Interpretation Scheme is:  pn_binary 
Fitness Scheme is:  error 
Value of output node shunt resistance = 10.000000 kOhm
 
The Material netowk model used = D_RN 
Where the Default diodes used? = 1 
      Default diodes properties: IS=20@u_uA, RS=0.8@u_mOhm, BV=30@u_V, IBV=200@u_uV, N=1 
Material Properties are: 
  > Resistors randomly chosen between [0.100000, 10.000000] 

Note: the saved data includes the initial population best fitness and genome 
      So read outputs in chunks of 41
