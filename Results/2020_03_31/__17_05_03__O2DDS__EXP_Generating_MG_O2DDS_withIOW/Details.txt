Interpretation Scheme is:  pn_binary 
Fitness Scheme is:  error 
Value of output node shunt resistance = 10.000000 kOhm
 
The Material netowk model used = R_RN 
Material Properties are: 
  > Resistors randomly chosen between [0, 10] 

Note: the saved data includes the initial population best fitness and genome 
      So read outputs in chunks of 16

A variable Vconfig material graph computation was carried out: 
  Length x1 data = 41 
  Length x2 data = 41 
  Vconfig_1 considered = [-6 -3  0  3  6] 
  Vconfig_2 considered = [-6 -3  0  3  6] 
  Total number of chunks to split up = 25
