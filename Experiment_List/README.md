# Experiment List Folder

These are folders for different simulation experiments.
They are divided into training data headers.
Inside each folder is a list of experiments carried out with that particular data set.

These experiments contain DataDir.csv folders which point to the data stored in the results folder.
They also contain graphs, information etc. from the Experiment that was run.
